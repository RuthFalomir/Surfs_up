# Surfs_up

## Overview of the analysis: 
During this project, we want to fulfill an investment project due to our new-found passion for surfing in Hawaii. After contacting a possible investor, we understood the importance of developing a weather analysis of the city we are interested in, as well as other ppossible city alternatives in case ours isn't the best option. To start the analysis, we focused on the island of Oahu, using a weather dataset that our investor provided. 

During the analysis, we made sure to look into different weather characteristics such as:
- Rain
The goal is to find a place with just enough rain to keep everything green, but not too much miss having nice weather.
- Temperature
- Station data
Using data provided by 9 weather stations around the island.


## Results: 
We found interesting results during our analysis.
First of all, we plotted the precipitation data of the year 2017 to get a better, visual understanding of rainfall patterns throughout the years.

As we can see in the graph, we have a constant rainfall inches throughout the years, but enough months with less rainfall to keep the weather balanced. Just what we were looking for. 

We specifically looked into the months of June and December to get a better sense of how the surf & ice cream shop would do year-round. 

Below, we can see statistical information about both of these months. 

### June information

June presented temperatures around the 70's F. The average temperature was 74.94, with the minimun being 64 and the maximun temperature being 85. 

### December Information

December has temperatures around the 60's F to low 70's. The average temperature was 71.04, with the minimun being 56 and the maximun temperature being 83. 

## Summary: 

Thanks to our analysis, we discovered that Oahu has a perfect weather for our project. We additionally found that our shop can be sustained throught the year, since the weather doesn't change drastically between summer and winter. Perhaps, some modifications we would need to provide to surfers and visitors in order to be better prepared during colder days. 

However, we will look further into the weather data, sinced there is more to deeper understand about this city. 

First, we will work to obtain weather statistics for each particular month. To be better prepared, we must understand the particulars. 

Second, we would like to include additional information about the ocean tides. We want to be sure that waves will be perfect for surfing all year round, not only weather.
